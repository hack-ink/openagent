## Usage

Set up your environment:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

The library provides comprehensive examples for all supported APIs. Check out the [`examples/`](examples/) directory for complete, runnable code:

- **[`chat.rs`](examples/chat.rs)** - Chat completions with streaming support
- **[`embedding.rs`](examples/embedding.rs)** - Text embeddings generation
- **[`file.rs`](examples/file.rs)** - File upload and management
- **[`batch.rs`](examples/batch.rs)** - Batch processing for cost optimization
- **[`response.rs`](examples/response.rs)** - Advanced response API with real-time streaming
- **[`mcp.rs`](examples/mcp.rs)** - Model Context Protocol integration

Run any example with:

```bash
cargo run --example chat
cargo run --example response
cargo run --example embedding
# ... etc
```

## Development

### Architecture

The library is organized into several key modules:

- **`api/`** - Core API implementations for different OpenAI endpoints
  - `chat.rs` - Chat completions API with streaming support
  - `embedding.rs` - Text embeddings generation
  - `file.rs` - File upload and management
  - `batch.rs` - Batch processing operations
  - `response.rs` - Advanced response API with real-time streaming
  - `type.rs` - Common types and utilities

- **`http.rs`** - HTTP client abstraction with retry logic and streaming
- **`mcp.rs`** - Model Context Protocol integration
- **`tool.rs`** - Function calling and tool execution framework
- **`agent.rs`** - High-level agent abstraction (work in progress)
- **`error.rs`** - Comprehensive error handling

### Key Design Principles

1. **Type Safety** - Leverages Rust's type system for compile-time correctness
2. **Async-First** - Built on tokio for high-performance async operations
3. **Streaming Support** - Real-time data processing with Server-Sent Events
4. **Modularity** - Clean separation of concerns with trait-based design
5. **Compatibility** - Works with OpenAI and OpenAI-compatible APIs
